This project demonstrates how to classify wine types using the classic Wine dataset from scikit-learn, and explores the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training with a Decision Tree Classifier, evaluation of misclassifications, and sets up the use of the LIME library for model explanation. The goal is to not only make accurate predictions, but also to help users understand which features influence the modelâ€™s decisions.
